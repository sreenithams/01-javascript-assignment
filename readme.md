- primitive data type
    Primitive data types are the built-in data types provided by JavaScript. They represent single values and are not mutable. JavaScript supports the following primitive data types
- non primitive
    These are derived from primitive data type

9.Differentiate null and undefined
- undefined
   When a variable is declared but not initialized, or when a function does not return a value, the variable or the functionâ€™s result is undefined.
   Accessing an object property or array element that does not exist also results in undefined.
   It is a primitive value.

- null
    It is a deliberate assignment that represents the absence of any object value.
    It is often used to explicitly indicate that a variable or object property should have no value or no reference to any object.
    It is also a primitive value.
